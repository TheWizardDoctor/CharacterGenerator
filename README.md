# Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition Character Generator

#### This is a python based program that will generate the Stats, Race, Class, Background, Proficeincies, Feats, Skills, and alignment of a character.

There will be 3 primary functions:
1. A Random Generator that will create a character at complete random.
2. A Psuedorandom Generator that will ask you at each step if you want it to randomly decide something or if you want to choose.
3. A Questionaire that will walk you through creating a character that fits certain characteristics.
